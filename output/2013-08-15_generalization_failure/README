Given image 1:

------ -----
----      ---------
------------

and image 2:

------------
----      ---------
------ -----

We can show that agents learn their environment by training on image 1 and
testing on image 2. Note that in this case the failure to generalize is not
something that can be overcome, even with a truly intelligent model. Without a
priori knowledge of the environment (ie with only local knowledge) it is
impossible for even a human walking down the street to know which fork is best
to take.


Training on (20x20 smoothed) testfork.png. Call best path soln1

Then test on (smoothed) testfork2.png. Show failure, call soln2.

This is motivation for attempting to generalize by evaluating each agent on many images and summing(?? or sum of normalized cost squared?) the costs.
